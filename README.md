👋 Hey there, I'm Noten!

🧑‍🎓 As a 15-year-old high school student, I have a passion for AI, game development, and web development. I'm currently interning as a developer at Onchat and as a Front-End developer at Justhink, while also working on personal projects. I'm always striving to improve my skills and become an even better developer! 😎
