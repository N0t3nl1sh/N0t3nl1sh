👋 Hey there, I'm Noten!

🧑‍🎓 As a 15-year-old high school student, I have a passion for AI, game development, and web development. I'm currently interning as a developer at Onchat and as a Front-End developer at Justhink, while also working on personal projects. I'm always striving to improve my skills and become an even better developer! 😎

📖 I have an intermediate level of proficiency in Python, HTML, and CSS, and I'm currently learning JavaScript. 

🌐 Feel free to reach out to me via Discord at N0t3nl1sh#2617, or visit my website to learn more about me and my work.
